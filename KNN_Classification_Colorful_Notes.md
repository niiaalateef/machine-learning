# 🤝 KNN Classification Notes

## Objective
Predict a person's class using **Height** and **Weight** with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

### Steps
1. Create a dictionary and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Select **Height** and **Weight** as features (`X`).
3. Select **Class** as the label (`y`).
4. Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.
5. Scale the data using `StandardScaler`.
6. Create the model using `KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)`.
7. Train the model using `fit()`.
8. Predict test data using `predict()`.
9. Calculate accuracy using `accuracy_score()`.
10. Scale new data and predict its class.

## Key Points
- KNN is a supervised classification algorithm.
- Scale features before training and prediction.
- `n_neighbors=3` means the model checks the 3 nearest neighbors.
- `accuracy_score()` measures classification accuracy.
